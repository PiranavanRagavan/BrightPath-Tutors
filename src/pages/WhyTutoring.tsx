              Our journey began when we were students who faced academics challenges. When studying for exams or doing assignments we struggled to find help when we needed it the most. Spent tried less nights on studying making sense of concepts and facing overload of school. We were faced with a wall that we were not capable of finding the right tools and people to helps on our academic journey.

              The of the major issue we found with tutors was personalized help, rather many of them went with big groups. Which did tend my needs and challenges I was facing at school. The lack guidance made us feel we are not gaining anything form it. So we decided to start our tutoring companies, built of our story and struggles. We decided incorporate all aspects faces trouble with so no other student would need to go through it. BrightPath Tutoring incorporates:
